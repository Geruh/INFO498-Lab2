1. Clone your forked repo into your local machine
2. `cd` into the repo
3. Create a development branch separate from master via `git checkout -b dev`
4. Set up compiler configuration file tsconfig.json via `tsc --init`
5. Code your algorithm for the given specifications in problem-a.ts
6. Test your changes by compiling the .ts file via `tsc ./exercise/problem-a.ts`  or `tsc --watch ./exercise/problem-a.ts` to auto-recompile on file save
7. Run the script via `node ./exercise/problem-a.js` and check if your code passes the given tests
8. If your code passes the tests, `add`, `commit`, and `push` your code to `dev`.
9. Create a pull request to merge your commits from `dev` into `master` in **your** repository, rather than the repo you forked from
10. Pair up with someone next to you and add each other as contributors to your repos
11. Perform a peer code review of your partner's algorithm
